Ria is a banker who has a good bakery in NY. On seeing success of business, she wanted to expand to LA, so she applied for a loan of 50k from central bank. She comes to know that the bank later rejects it bcs of the borrowing limit decided by the centralized system. Angry she talks to a finance expert to understand how centralized system of banks works.

In centralized finance, banks and businesses use the money you lend or take out to make profits. And their objective is to make money. 3rd parties or merchants control transactions each charging a fee for her service. The limit was either decided by the bank or the third parties for her. Ria was upset that she couldn't grow her busienss and so the financial expert, Lisa, recommended opting in for DeFi. Ria got confused by the term and got confused. 

DeFi is a piece of code that eliminates middlemen or banks by allowing individuals, business merchants and corporations to perform financial transactions using developing technologies. Peer to peer financial networks that provide security protocols and connectivity to the transactions are used to make this happen. Stable coin is a security banked by an asset. Ria was fascinated about how it works and how it helps her loan get approved.

Lisa further adds that DeFi uses consensus mechanism to eliminate finance models by eliminating anyone or everyone to utilize financial services. Regardless of who they are or where they are a consensus mechanism is how there is trust and security across a decentralized computer network. As it runs in a decentralized environment. it provides the environment where you can make Decentralized programs or Dapps. Transactions are stored in blocks and can be created, broadcasted, validated, or added to the chain. 

Rejected by lower limit in the CeFi. But in DeFi she can ask through Dapps and this would match her up with peers who could help her. After that she would agree to the lenders terms. The transaction will then be securely stored in the blockchain which is a ledger that is impossible to hack. Or any kind of mallicious intervention. Once verified by the consensus mechanism the transaction will be complete.

The lender can also then begin collecting their payments at the agreed upon intervals. Cheaper and better bcs of DeFi. conduct transactions through cryptocurrency because tech is still evolving it's difficult to say how all cryptos will be applied.
